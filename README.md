Moodify: A WeirdMoodTracker

A quirky and fun mood tracker built with React, allowing users to select their mood, view mood history, track mood streaks, and receive odd, funny advice based on their emotional state. Perfect for users who want to add weirdness and fun to their day!

Features Mood Selection: Choose from a list of moods (Happy, Sad, Stressed, Relaxed, Neutral) with each mood offering unique messages and quirky advice. Mood History Timeline: Logs and displays recent moods, with humorous advice for each entry. Mood Streaks: Tracks consecutive mood entries, displaying a streak count and funny message if you're “stuck” on one mood. Random Mood Mashup: Combines two random moods and generates an eccentric mashup message for added fun. Dynamic Font Sizes: Mood message font size changes randomly every two seconds to keep things visually engaging. Animated Icons: Each mood is represented by an icon that spins, bounces, or otherwise animates, adding a whimsical touch.
